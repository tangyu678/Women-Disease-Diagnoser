# Women-Disease-Diagnoser

This program diagnoses some common diseases prevalent in women based on reported symptoms (around 170 listed).
The predicted diseases are ordered by prevalence of symptoms.

Of course, this is ***not*** a substitute of a doctor's advice in any way. This is a work-under-progress and needs
much improvement in order to be a reliable guide for a patient's health.
